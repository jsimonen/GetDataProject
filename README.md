========================================================

This folder contains the R script *run_analysis.R*. It is meant to process accelerometer and gyroscope data from a Samsung Galaxy S2 smartphone, producing a tidy data set. The original and tidy data, the transformations and the variables are described in the file *CodeBook.md*

This code was written as a Course Project for a Coursera online course called Getting and Cleaning Data. 

The author of the analysis script and the documentation is Janne Simonen.
